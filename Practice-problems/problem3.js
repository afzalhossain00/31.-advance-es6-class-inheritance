/* 1) Challenging Follow above array of objects. So, you have 3 objects as
array element. Can you find out the total sum from here?
20 + 15 + 22 = 57 . The output will be 57
What are you thinking? Yeah! Do it with for loop. I know you can do it.
But! Wait !! Wait !!! Do the same task using array.reduce() method. */

// Using Reduce:
const newReduce = people.reduce((acc, obj) => acc + obj.age, 0);

// Using For Loop:
let sum = 0;
